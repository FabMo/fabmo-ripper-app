# FabMo Ripper

This app is meant to be a demonstration "toolbox" or "swiss army knife" app - it is one of a small constellation of apps that do specific CNC tasks, mimicking the function of a conventional power tool. (In this case, a panel saw)

## Usage

This app provides a display showing the machine bed, and allows you to click in a location to choose a place to make a rip cut.  Once you have chosen the location, either by clicking or by entering the location in the location entry box, you can select the cuts to make by clicking on quadrant lines in the user interface.  Once the selections have been made, cick "Rip!" to actually conduct the cut.

## Dependencies

This app strives to be minimalistic in its dependencies.  The only 3rd party "framework" in use here is Bulma, which provides no-fuss styling in a responsive format.
